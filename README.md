FFmpeg is an all-in-one tool for multimedia manipulation. But the deeper I dove into it, the more frustrated I became with its endless command options — and honestly, I’m too lazy to memorize them all or lookup for them! So I decided to develop this command-line tool using Bash and gum to create a TUI, designed for lazy people like me who still want to harness the power of this incredibly useful project called FFmpeg.
