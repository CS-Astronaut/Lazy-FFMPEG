## Why Lazy-FFMPEG does Exist?

FFmpeg is an all-in-one tool for multimedia manipulation. But the deeper I dove into it, the more frustrated I became with its endless command options 😴 and honestly, I’m too lazy to memorize them all or lookup for them! So I decided to develop this command-line tool using Bash and gum to create a TUI, designed for lazy people like me who still want to harness the power of this incredibly useful project called FFmpeg.


## Let's Use it!

Clone The Repo:
```bash
clone https://github.com/CS-Astronaut/Lazy-FFMPEG
cd Lazy-FFMPEG
```

Install Dependencies:
```bash
# Install gum for TUI
go install github.com/charmbracelet/gum@latest
#or
brew install gum
```
```bash
# Install FFmpeg for Processings
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

Give Execution Permission:
```bash
chmod +x lzfmpg.sh
chmod +x modules/*/*.sh
```

Run:
```bash
./lzfmpg.sh
```
